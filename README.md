# Story

The year is 3033. A really bad AI experiment has resulted in robots taking over the world. They've learned to manufacture themselves. They've eliminated most of the world's human population. Only a few survivors are left - sparsely distributed throughout the world. As long as you appease your robot overlords, they have no need to kill you anymore. They know they've won...or have they?

You wake up hearing your father talking. He tells you that you were dead and that he managed to bring you back to life. You remember nothing. You wake up to see yourself - half human, half robot. A cyborg. Your father tells you to go deliver a letter to the robot tyrant...and so your journey begins.
